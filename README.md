# TheCheekyBlindersProject

Indian Government data visulatization tool.


## Our Goal

Indian Government data is available freely on the internet, but very few know about it. Even those who know about lack the required technical knowledge to understand it. It is available in API or CSV format but lacks the advanced technical environment that will allow a normal Indian Resident with a non-tech background to analyse it. We aim to make it much more presentable, readable, analyzable.


## Project Requirements

The basic need for the current system is a frontend which can interact with already existing government API's to represnt the data.

SDLC will include the following phases..

1. Phase I - MVP **[2 Months]**
    * Architecture Finalisation
    
    * Data Cleansing 

    * Development
        * FrontEnd Design - [UIZARD](https://app.uizard.io/prototypes/3ox4LKABV5Hver5jjgly)

        * Representation 
            * Tables
            * Charts
            * Timelines
            * Graphs
            * Venn Diagrams

        * Segregation
            1. On the basis of domains
            2. On the basis of volume of data
            3. On the basis of Popularity of API's

    * Testing
    * Deployment
